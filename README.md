# Big Market Sales Prediction

## Project Overview
The Big Market Sales Prediction project aims to predict sales for a big market based on various features such as advertising budget, location, seasonality, and more. This is a regression problem where the goal is to predict continuous sales values. The project utilizes machine learning algorithms including Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest to build predictive models.

## Libraries Used
- **NumPy:** For numerical computations and array manipulation.
- **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib:** For data visualization.
- **Seaborn:** For statistical data visualization.
- **scikit-learn (sklearn):** For machine learning algorithms, model evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning.

## Steps Performed
1. **Data Preparation:**
   - Imported the dataset and performed initial exploration.
   - Split the data into training and testing sets using train-test split.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Handled missing values through imputation techniques such as mean or median imputation.
   - Encoded categorical variables using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding.
   - Performed feature scaling to standardize or normalize the feature variables.

3. **Model Building:**
   - Utilized various machine learning algorithms:
     - Linear Regression
     - Decision Tree
     - Random Forest
   - Built separate models for each algorithm using the training data.

4. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Evaluated model performance using appropriate regression metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared.
   - Identified the best performing model based on evaluation metrics.

5. **Hyperparameter Tuning:**
   - Performed hyperparameter tuning using techniques like grid search or randomized search to optimize model performance.
   - Tuned hyperparameters for each algorithm to improve the model's predictive capability.

6. **Generalized Model:**
   - Built a generalized model with low bias and low variance by fine-tuning hyperparameters and optimizing model architecture.
   - Ensured that the model is robust and capable of making accurate predictions on unseen data.
